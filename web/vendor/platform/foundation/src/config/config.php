	| This variable holds the current installed version of Platform.
	|
	| You are highly discouraged from touching this, ever.
	|
	| How It Works:
	|
	|  - On a blank installation, the installed version will be FALSE, which
	|    means Platform isn't installed.
	|
	|  - We'll check this version against the PLATFORM_VERSION constant and
	|    if this version is less, it means you have upgraded the Platform
	|    codebase, we'll then lock out the application and send you to
	|    the installer where you'll be taken through the upgrade process.
