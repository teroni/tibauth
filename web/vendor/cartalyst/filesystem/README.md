# Filesystem

[![Build Status](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/svg/11)](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/view/11)

A framework agnostic filesystem package with multiple adapters like AwsS3 and Dropbox.

The package requires PHP 5.4+ and comes bundled with a Laravel 4 Facade and a Service Provider to simplify the optional framework integration and follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.

Part of the Cartalyst Arsenal & licensed [Cartalyst PSL](LICENSE). Code well, rock on.
