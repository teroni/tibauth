# Data Grid

[![Build Status](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/svg/7)](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/view/7)

A framework agnostic data grid package that makes it easy to filter large data sources. It shifts the focus from pagination to data filtration. Pass any data source through a data handler and the package will take care of the rest so you can use the filtered result set to create your applications.

The package requires PHP 5.3+ and comes bundled with a Laravel 4 Facade and a Service Provider to simplify the optional framework integration and follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.

Part of the Cartalyst Arsenal & licensed [Cartalyst PSL](LICENSE). Code well, rock on.
