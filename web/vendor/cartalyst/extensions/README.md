# Extensions

[![Build Status](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/svg/19)](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/view/19)

A starter kit for building modular, extensions-based applications. Extension instances are created from a `extension.php` file.

The package requires PHP 5.3+ and follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is fully unit-tested.

Part of the Cartalyst Arsenal & licensed [Cartalyst PSL](LICENSE). Code well, rock on.
